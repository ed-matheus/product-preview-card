# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component
![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hey there! Welcome to another built challenge!

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. 
That's a landing page with a product preview card component, built with basic HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, using more CSS to make the page responsive to other screens.

You can check my other projects and codes in my 'desenvolvimento-web' repository, or on the other ones. See you later!
